  "narrative": "As I sat down to tackle my 2023 taxes, I couldn't help but think about the miles I had put on my trusty old sedan. Between driving to client meetings and shuttling around the city for work events, my vehicle had been my faithful companion all year. I decided to take a closer look at my records to see if I had enough documentation to claim the standard mileage rate for business use of a vehicle. A quick check revealed that the standard mileage rate for 2023 was 65.5 cents per mile, which seemed like a reasonable estimate considering the rising cost of fuel and maintenance.\n\nI remembered keeping a log throughout the year to track my business and personal use miles, which would come in handy for calculating my business use percentage. According to my records, I had driven a total of 12,000 miles in 2023, with 8,000 miles dedicated to business use. This worked out to a business use percentage of approximately 66.7%. Given that my vehicle was used for more than 50% business purposes, I decided to claim the standard mileage rate for my business use miles. Using this rate, I was able to calculate my deduction as 8,000 miles x 65.5 cents per mile, which came out to a tidy $5,240.\n\nI was relieved to have a clear and straightforward solution for my vehicle expense deduction. I made a mental note to continue keeping my log up to date in 2024, as the standard mileage rate was increasing to 69.6 cents per mile. This would give me a chance to take advantage of the higher rate and potentially claim an even larger deduction. With my vehicle expense deduction squared away, I felt more confident and prepared to tackle the rest of my taxes.",
