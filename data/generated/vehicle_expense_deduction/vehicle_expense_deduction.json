  "narrative": "As the owner of a small consulting firm, I knew it was essential to accurately track business expenses to ensure I was taking advantage of all the deductions available to me. One of the key benefits of running my own business was the ability to write off certain expenses on my tax return. At the top of that list was the business use percentage of my vehicle, a sedan I used for both personal and professional purposes. To accurately calculate this percentage, I had to maintain a log of all the miles I drove in a given year.\n\nOver the course of 12 months, I logged every single mile I drove in my vehicle, totaling 25,000 miles. Breaking down this number into business and personal use was crucial, as the IRS only allows businesses to deduct the percentage of miles driven for work-related purposes. After carefully reviewing my log, I determined that 12,000 miles of the total 25,000 miles were driven for business use. This breakdown was essential in calculating the business use percentage of my vehicle, which would ultimately impact my ability to deduct expenses such as gas, maintenance, and insurance on my tax return.\n\nMaintaining a log of business miles may seem like a tedious task, but it was an essential step in ensuring I was accurately tracking my business expenses. The log allowed me to not only calculate the business use percentage of my vehicle but also to identify areas where I could improve my record-keeping and minimize potential errors on my tax return. By being meticulous about tracking my business miles, I was able to take full advantage of the deductions available to me and reduce my taxable income accordingly.",

  "question": "What vehicle expenses are deductible?",
  "correct_answer": "$9,600",
  "reasoning_steps": [
    "The business use percentage must be calculated based on the vehicle log, but at least 50% of total miles driven is required for the vehicle to be considered business-use-eligible.",
    "The total miles driven in one year is 25000, and the business use must be at least 50% of this total, so the minimum business use is 25000 * 0.5 = 12500 miles.",
    "However, the vehicle was driven 12000 miles for business use, which exceeds the minimum business use of 12500 miles.",
    "To calculate the business use percentage, the business use miles (12000) divided by the total miles driven (25000) is 0.48, or 48%."
