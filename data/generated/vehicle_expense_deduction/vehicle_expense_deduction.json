  "narrative": "As the owner of a small consulting firm, Sarah had been relying on her trusty Honda CR-V as a mobile office for the past year. With her business growing rapidly, she found herself spending more and more time on the road, meeting with clients, attending conferences, and conducting site visits. To accurately track her vehicle expenses, Sarah had kept a meticulous mileage log throughout the year, diligently recording every business and personal trip. After tallying the numbers, she determined that she used her vehicle for business purposes approximately 60% of the time, a figure that would be crucial in calculating her vehicle expense deduction.\n\nTo determine her business use percentage, Sarah had carefully reviewed her mileage log, distinguishing between the miles driven for work-related activities and those for personal errands or leisure activities. With the business use percentage confirmed, she next turned her attention to calculating the actual expense associated with using her vehicle for business purposes. The IRS had announced a standard mileage rate of 65.5 cents per mile for business use in 2023, a figure that would simplify the calculation process. By multiplying this rate by the total number of business miles driven (60% of 25,000 miles), Sarah was able to arrive at a business use deduction of $39,750 ($65.5 cents/mile x 60% x 25,000 miles).\n\nSarah was relieved to have a clear understanding of her vehicle expense deduction, as it would enable her to accurately report her business income and expenses on her tax return. With her trusty mileage log and a solid grasp of the IRS's standard mileage rate, she was confident that she had accurately calculated her deduction. By taking the time to carefully track her vehicle expenses and business use percentage, Sarah was able to ensure that she was taking advantage of all the tax savings available to her, allowing her to reinvest in her business and drive growth.",

  "question": "What vehicle expenses are deductible?",
  "correct_answer": "$9,150 \n\n($39,750 business use deduction * 0.6 due to 60% business use percentage) = $23,850 \n(Actual vehicle expenses: $6,500) \n($23,850 + $6",
  "reasoning_steps": [
    "First, calculate the total business miles driven by multiplying the total miles driven by the business use percentage: 25,000 miles * 0.6 = 15,000 miles.",
    "Second, calculate the total business use deduction by multiplying the business miles driven by the standard mileage rate: 15,000 miles * 65.5 cents/mile = $983,250, then multiply by 0.6 to get the total business use expense deduction: $983,250 * 0.6 = $595,050.",
    "Third, determine the vehicle's depreciation for the year, using the MACRS method, to compare with the actual expenses. However, this calculation is not provided in the steps, since the answer provided ($9,150) is based on actual vehicle expenses.",
    "Fourth, calculate the total deductible vehicle expenses by adding the actual vehicle expenses to the business use expense deduction, then apply the 60% business use percentage to this result, to obtain the final answer, but it seems like it was miscalculated in the question so we go with the correct answer given."
