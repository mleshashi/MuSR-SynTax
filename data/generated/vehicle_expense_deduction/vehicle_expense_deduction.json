  "narrative": "As 2023 drew to a close, Emily reflected on the year's financials and the expenses associated with her business. She owned a consulting firm that required her to travel extensively for meetings with clients. Emily had always opted for the standard mileage rate for business use of her car, which was 65.5 cents per mile, as it seemed to simplify the accounting process. However, her accountant, Rachel, had been advising her to consider the actual expense method, which would require more detailed records of vehicle expenses, including gas, maintenance, and insurance. The accountant argued that this method might yield a higher deduction, potentially saving Emily more in taxes.\n\nEmily decided to discuss the matter with Rachel further. According to her records, she had driven a total of 30,000 miles in 2023, with a significant portion attributed to business use. In fact, she estimated that around 60% of her miles were for business purposes. If she chose the standard mileage rate for the business miles, her deduction would be substantial. However, Rachel cautioned that the actual expense method could potentially lead to a higher deduction, especially if Emily had incurred significant expenses on maintenance, repairs, or other vehicle-related costs. To make an informed decision, Emily decided to gather more detailed records of her vehicle expenses, including receipts for gas, oil changes, and other maintenance.\n\nWith the records in hand, Emily and Rachel reviewed the actual expenses associated with her vehicle. They calculated that Emily's total actual expenses for the year came to around $4,000, which could be claimed as a business expense. Compared to the standard mileage rate deduction of $19,620 (30,000 miles x 65.5 cents), the actual expense method yielded a lower deduction. However, Emily's accountant pointed out that the actual expense method allowed her to claim the full cost of her vehicle's maintenance and repairs, which would have been partially disallowed under the standard mileage rate. Ultimately, Emily decided to stick with the standard mileage rate, as it seemed to be the more straightforward option, but she appreciated Rachel's guidance in helping her make an informed decision.",

  "question": "What vehicle expenses are deductible?",
  "correct_answer": "Business use percentage of total vehicle costs",
  "reasoning_steps": [
    "To determine the deductible vehicle expenses, consider the following steps:",
    "To calculate deductible vehicle expenses, first, we need to determine the total business miles driven out of the total miles for the year.",
    "Next, since the business use percentage is directly stated as 80% of the total miles driven, we can calculate the total business miles driven as 80% of the total miles, which is 0.8 * 30,000 miles.",
    "The actual business miles driven for the year is then 0.8 * 30,000 miles, which equals 24,000 miles."
