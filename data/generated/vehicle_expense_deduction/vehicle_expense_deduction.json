  "narrative": "As the financial year drew to a close, Emily began to tally up the expenses for her company's vehicle. The vehicle had been in use for 12 months, and the odometer reading at the start of the year was 12,000 miles. By the end of the year, the vehicle had traveled a total of 20,000 miles. Emily knew that she could use the standard mileage rate to calculate the vehicle expense deduction, rather than tracking actual expenses for gas, maintenance, and repairs.\n\nTo calculate the deduction, Emily first determined the business use percentage of the vehicle, which was 40%. This meant that the vehicle was driven for business purposes 40% of the time, and personal use was 60%. Next, she looked up the standard mileage rate for the year, which was 65.5 cents per mile. Multiplying the total miles driven (20,000) by the business use percentage (0.4) gave her the miles driven for business purposes (8,000). Finally, she calculated the business use deduction by multiplying the business miles (8,000) by the standard mileage rate (65.5 cents per mile), which resulted in a deduction of $5,240.\n\nEmily was confident that she had accurately calculated the vehicle expense deduction. She would submit this amount to the accounting department, who would review and ensure that all expenses were properly recorded. The vehicle expense deduction would be an important part of the company's overall tax strategy, and Emily was relieved to have this calculation behind her.",

  "question": "What vehicle expenses are deductible?",
  "correct_answer": "$5,240 (standard mileage rate) + $0 (actual expenses, as the business use percentage is 40%, but only 40% of $4000 in gas is $1600 and 40% of $2000 in maintenance",
  "reasoning_steps": [
    "Calculate the total business miles driven by multiplying the total miles by the business use percentage: 20,000 miles * 0.4 = 8,000 miles.",
    "Determine the standard mileage deduction by multiplying the business miles by the standard mileage rate: 8,000 miles * $0.655 per mile = $5,240.",
    "Calculate the actual business expenses by multiplying the actual vehicle expenses by the business use percentage: ($4,000 in gas * 0.4) + ($2,000 in maintenance * 0.4) = $1,600 + $800 = $2,400.",
    "Determine the total deductible vehicle expenses by selecting the lower of the standard mileage deduction and the actual business expenses, which is $2,400 in this case."
