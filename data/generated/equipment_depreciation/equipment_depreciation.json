  "narrative": "As the new year began, Smith & Co. was eager to upgrade its office infrastructure to better support the growing needs of the business. After careful consideration, the company's management decided to invest in a suite of state-of-the-art office equipment, including printers, copiers, and computers. The total cost for the new equipment came out to $30,000, a significant investment in the company's ability to function efficiently.\n\nThe equipment was installed and put into service on January 1, marking the start of its five-year Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS) recovery period. According to the IRS guidelines, the company would be able to depreciate the equipment over this five-year period, with a specific percentage of the total cost deductible each year. This would allow the company to claim a significant portion of the equipment's cost as a tax deduction, reducing its taxable income and ultimately minimizing its tax liability.\n\nAs the company's accountant began to work on the tax returns, he noted that the 5-year MACRS recovery period would result in the following depreciation schedule: 20% in the first year, 32% in the second year, 19.2% in the third year, 11.52% in the fourth year, and 5.76% in the fifth year. This would enable the company to depreciate the office equipment by $6,000 in the first year, $9,600 in the second year, $5,760 in the third year, $3,475 in the fourth year, and $1,728 in the fifth year. By claiming these depreciation deductions, Smith & Co. would be able to reduce its taxable income and minimize its tax liability, making the most of its investment in the new office equipment.",

  "question": "What is the annual depreciation deduction?",
  "correct_answer": "$6,000",
  "reasoning_steps": [
    "The annual depreciation deduction for the office equipment can be calculated using the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS) as follows:",
    "The business uses the equipment 75% for business purposes, so it will be eligible for a business use percentage of 75% of the total depreciation deduction.",
    "The equipment is placed in service on January 1 and falls under the 5-year MACRS recovery period, so the annual depreciation rate is 20% (1/5th of the total).",
    "The total equipment purchases for the year were $80000, but since the question specifies $30000 of office equipment, we will focus on this specific asset."
