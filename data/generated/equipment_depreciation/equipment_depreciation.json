  "narrative": "As we reviewed our company's financial statements for the year ending 2022, it became apparent that our recent investment in a new computer system was a significant expense. The $120,000 purchase price was a substantial outlay, but we believed it was necessary to upgrade our technology infrastructure and increase efficiency. The computer system, which was placed in service on January 15, 2022, was quickly integrated into our operations and has been a valuable addition to our team.\n\nUnder the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS), computer systems are classified as 5-year property, which means that we will depreciate the asset over a period of five years. This classification was taken into consideration when we calculated the annual depreciation expense for the computer system. For the year ending 2022, the depreciation expense was calculated using the straight-line method, which provided a depreciation rate of 20% per year. This means that the annual depreciation expense for the computer system is $24,000 ($120,000 / 5 years).\n\nAs we move forward with our financial planning, we will continue to depreciate the computer system over the remaining four years, with annual depreciation expenses of $24,000. This will help to reduce our taxable income and minimize our tax liability. Our accountant will ensure that the depreciation expense is accurately recorded in our financial statements and that we comply with all relevant tax laws and regulations.",
