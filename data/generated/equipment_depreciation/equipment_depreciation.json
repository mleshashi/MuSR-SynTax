  "narrative": "As I sat at my desk, pouring over the financials for our small manufacturing business, I couldn't help but feel a sense of accomplishment. Just a few months ago, we had made a significant investment in new equipment, purchasing a state-of-the-art machine for $30,000. The team was thrilled with the upgrade, and production had already seen a notable boost. From a tax perspective, I knew we needed to account for the depreciation of this asset, which was classified as 5-year property under the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS).\n\nAfter consulting the MACRS table, I confirmed that our new equipment would be depreciated over a 5-year period, with a half-year convention applied to the first and last years of ownership. This meant that the equipment would be depreciated in the following pattern: 20% in year one, 32% in year two, 19.2% in year three, 11.52% in year four, and 5.76% in year five. I also took note that since the equipment was placed in service in 2026, bonus depreciation would be available. This would allow us to depreciate an additional 80% of the equipment's cost in the first year, resulting in a total first-year depreciation of $24,000 ($30,000 x 80%) + ($30,000 x 20% = $6,000).\n\nAs I entered the depreciation schedule into our accounting software, I felt confident that we had accurately accounted for the asset's value. The bonus depreciation would provide a significant tax benefit in the first year, and the MACRS schedule would ensure that we were depreciating the equipment consistently over its useful life. With this in mind, I was able to project our tax liability for the upcoming year and make informed decisions about our financial planning.",

  "question": "What is the annual depreciation deduction?",
  "correct_answer": "$6,400 \n\n$24,000 (bonus depreciation) + $2,400 (20% of $12,000, business use percentage of $30,000)",
  "reasoning_steps": [
    "The business equipment is classified as 5-year property under MACRS, but the bonus depreciation available for assets placed in service before January 1, 2027, applies to the overall purchase price, allowing for first-year depreciation of $30,000.",
    "The business use percentage is 80%, but the bonus depreciation applies to the entire purchase price, not just the business use portion, resulting in $24,000 of bonus depreciation.",
    "The remaining undepreciated basis after the bonus depreciation would be $6,000 ($30,000 - $24,000). However, since the equipment has a 5-year recovery period, the business will depreciate the remaining basis over 5 years.",
    "The annual depreciation for the remaining basis of $6,000 over 5 years would be $1,200 per year, but this is not part of the provided answer."
