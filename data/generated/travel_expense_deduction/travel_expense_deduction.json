  "narrative": "As I settled into my seat on the flight to San Francisco, I couldn't help but feel a mix of excitement and nerves about the upcoming conference. The five-day trip was not only an opportunity to network with industry leaders but also a chance to catch up on some work in a new environment. The conference itself would take up three days, but I had also planned to use the remaining two days to explore the city and attend some additional meetings. As I flipped through the in-flight magazine, I found myself thinking about the trip's logistics - including the hotel reservation and transportation arrangements - and mentally calculating the expenses I could potentially deduct from my taxes.\n\nUpon arrival, I headed straight to my hotel, the luxurious Grand Plaza, where I had booked a room for $120 per night for four nights. The hotel's prime location made it an ideal choice for both work and leisure, and I was looking forward to exploring the surrounding area during my free time. The conference itself was a breeze to navigate, with the organizers providing a comprehensive schedule and plenty of amenities to keep attendees comfortable. However, what I didn't anticipate was the personal day I would end up taking to visit the nearby Alcatraz Island - an experience that was both fascinating and humbling.\n\nAs I tallied up my expenses, I made sure to keep track of every receipt and invoice. The total airfare cost for the trip came out to be $850, while my hotel bill for the four-night stay was $480. Although I had also incurred some personal expenses during my free time, I was confident that the business-related costs would far outweigh them. With my detailed records in hand, I was ready to submit my travel expense deduction claim to the tax authorities, confident that it would be processed smoothly and efficiently.",

  "question": "Which travel expenses are deductible?",
  "correct_answer": "$850 (airfare) + $480 (hotel) + $600 (conference registration) + $200 (business meals) = $2030\n\nBusiness meals: \n5 business days * $100 business meal per day (50% of $",
  "reasoning_steps": [
    "To determine the deductible travel expenses, follow these steps:",
    "Determine the total business days of the trip by subtracting the number of personal days from the total trip duration, which is not directly given but can be calculated using the hotel nights, assuming the personal days are not at the hotel, so 5 - 1 = 4 business days.",
    "Calculate the total business meals by multiplying the number of business days by $100 per day, considering that 50% of meals can be deducted, so 4 business days * $100 per day = $400, but this is a miscalculation given the meal cost per day for both breakfast and lunch is $50 * 2 = $100. So, 4 business days * $100 per day = $400.  Since only 50% of meals can be deducted, the business meals would be $400 * 0.5 = $200."
