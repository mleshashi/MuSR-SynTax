  "narrative": "As I settled into my hotel room in downtown Chicago, I couldn't help but feel a mix of excitement and exhaustion. I had spent the past five days traveling from my tax home to meet with key clients for our company's upcoming project. The meetings had been productive, and I was confident that we were on track to secure the contract. However, the constant travel had taken its toll, and I was grateful to have a quiet evening to myself to unwind.\n\nDuring my stay, I had booked a hotel room at $120 per night for four nights, which added up to a total of $480. As I reflected on the trip, I realized that the hotel expense was a necessary one, and I was eligible to deduct it as a business expense on my tax return. According to our company's travel policy, hotel costs are deductible when the primary purpose of the trip is business-related, which was certainly the case here.\n\nI made a mental note to keep the hotel receipt and expense report, as I would need to claim the deduction on our company's expense report and also on my personal tax return. As I drifted off to sleep, I felt a sense of satisfaction knowing that I had made the most of my trip and was able to deduct the legitimate business expenses, including the hotel costs, come tax time.",

  "question": "Which travel expenses are deductible?",
  "correct_answer": "$480 (hotel expense) \n$450 (airfare) \n$80 * 1 (business meal) = $80",
  "reasoning_steps": [
    "The primary purpose of the trip was business, as evidenced by the fact that John spent 5 days away from his tax home on business and the primary purpose of the trip was to meet with clients. This indicates that the majority of the expenses are deductible.",
    "The total hotel expense for the 4 nights at $120 per night is $480, which can be deducted as a business expense since the primary purpose of the trip was business.",
    "The total airfare cost of $450 for a round trip is a necessary expense for the business trip and can be deducted as a business expense.",
    "John spent $80 on meals per day for 3 days of personal travel, but only 1 day of this was business-related. Therefore, only 1 day of the $80 per day can be deducted as a business expense, which is $80."
