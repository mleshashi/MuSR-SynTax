  "narrative": "John had been preparing for the annual marketing conference for weeks, pouring over his notes and presentations in anticipation of the keynotes and networking opportunities. As the Vice President of Sales at a growing tech firm, he knew that this event was crucial for expanding their client base and staying ahead of the competition. With a packed schedule of meetings and presentations, John was confident that this trip would be a valuable investment for the company.\n\nAs he boarded the plane for the four-day trip, John felt a mix of excitement and anticipation. He was looking forward to catching up with long-time clients, as well as meeting new ones, and was eager to share the company's latest innovations with the industry. The conference itself was being held in a bustling metropolis, and John was excited to explore the city whenever he had some free time. With a focus on making meaningful connections and driving business growth, John was ready to make the most of his time away from the office.\n\nUpon his return, John carefully reviewed his expenses to ensure that he was properly reimbursed for the costs associated with his trip. He submitted a claim for $800, the total cost of his airfare, which he had carefully documented and accounted for. As he waited for his employer to process the reimbursement, John took comfort in knowing that this trip had been a success, and that the relationships he had built and the business opportunities he had explored would pay dividends for months to come.",

  "question": "Which travel expenses are deductible?",
  "correct_answer": "$800 (airfare) + $600 (hotel costs, 4 nights * $120/night) + $400 (meal costs, 8 days * $50/day, but 50% is paid by company, so 50%",
  "reasoning_steps": [
    "The expenses John incurred on the business trip are deductible if they meet the requirements of business-related travel under the tax code.",
    "John's primary purpose for the trip was to attend a conference and meet clients, which aligns with business-related travel.",
    "To determine the deductible expenses, calculate the total business-related expenses incurred during the trip and then apply the applicable tax rules.",
    "To calculate the total deductible travel expenses, start with the airfare, then add the hotel costs for the nights spent away from the tax home, and finally calculate the business meal costs and apply the 50% reimbursement rule for meals paid by the company."
