  "narrative": "As the founder of a small marketing firm, I've been fortunate enough to attend several industry conferences in recent years, including the annual AdAge conference in New York City. My company specializes in digital advertising solutions, and attending these conferences allows me to stay up-to-date on the latest trends and network with potential clients and partners. This year's conference in New York was a particular highlight, as I was able to connect with a major cosmetics brand that was looking for a digital advertising agency to handle their national campaign.\n\nDuring my stay in New York, I also scheduled meetings with several clients from out of state, including a major food delivery service based in Chicago. These meetings were crucial to closing deals and expanding our client base, and I was able to secure several new contracts as a result of my trip. As the owner of a small business, I know that staying connected with clients and partners is key to success, and attending conferences and meeting with clients in other states is an essential part of that.\n\nWhile my time in New York and Chicago was focused on business, I did incur some expenses that I was able to deduct on my tax return. These included airfare, hotel stays, meals, and transportation costs, which are all eligible expenses under IRC Section 162, which allows businesses to deduct expenses related to conferences and business travel. I kept detailed records of all my expenses, including receipts and itineraries, in order to ensure that I was eligible for the maximum deduction. By taking advantage of this tax deduction, I was able to reduce my taxable income and save money on my tax bill.",

  "question": "Which travel expenses are deductible?",
  "correct_answer": "Ordinary and necessary business travel costs",
  "reasoning_steps": [
    "The taxpayer's expenses for business travel qualify as ordinary and necessary business expenses under IRC Section 162 because they are incurred for a valid business purpose.",
    "The business purpose for the travel expenses is a legitimate business need, as conferences and client meetings qualify as valid business purposes under IRC Section 162.",
    "The travel expenses are for business purposes and qualify as away-from-home travel since the taxpayer's home is in a different state and the duration of the trip exceeds one week, meeting the away-from-home test.",
    "Therefore, the expenses for meals, lodging, and transportation are deductible as ordinary and necessary business expenses incurred for away-from-home business travel."
