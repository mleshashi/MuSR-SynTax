  "narrative": "As I sat at my desk, sipping my morning coffee and staring out the window of my home office, I couldn't help but think about the various expenses that came with running my own business from home. With a total square footage of 2500 sq ft, our family's house was spacious enough to accommodate a dedicated workspace for me. This 200 sq ft home office had become my sanctuary, where I spent countless hours juggling work calls, responding to emails, and brainstorming new ideas for my company.\n\nGiven the fact that I spent a significant amount of time working from home, I knew that I was eligible for a home office deduction on my taxes. But before I could claim it, I had to calculate the percentage of my home that was dedicated to my business. With my home office taking up about 8% of the total square footage, I was confident that I could substantiate my claim. To do so, I had to gather all the necessary expenses, including mortgage payments, property taxes, insurance, maintenance costs, and utilities. Fortunately, our annual home expenses totaled $18,000, which made it easier to itemize the costs and determine the business percentage.\n\nNow that I had all the necessary information, I was ready to crunch the numbers. By applying the home office deduction percentage to our total home expenses, I estimated that I could claim a significant portion of the costs as business expenses. This would not only reduce my taxable income but also help offset some of the expenses associated with running my business from home. With a solid understanding of the tax implications, I felt more confident and prepared to tackle the tax season ahead.",

  "question": "What percentage of home expenses can be deducted?",
  "correct_answer": "8%",
  "reasoning_steps": [
    "The home office is 200 sq ft, and the total square footage of the home is 2500 sq ft.",
    "Calculate the percentage of the home used for business by dividing the home office square footage by the total square footage of the home.",
    "The business use percentage is then multiplied by the annual home expenses.",
    "Since the home office is exclusively used for business 9 months of the year, the actual business use period needs to be accounted for in the calculation by multiplying the business use percentage by the annual home expenses and then dividing by 12."
