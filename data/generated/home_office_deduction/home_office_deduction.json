  "narrative": "As I settled into my home office, I couldn't help but appreciate the space I had carved out for myself. Located in the corner of our 2400 square foot house, the dedicated room measured 300 square feet, providing me with a quiet and private area to focus on my business. It was a setup that had worked well for me over the years, allowing me to balance my professional life with the comfort and familiarity of home. However, as the tax season approached, I knew I needed to take a moment to calculate the home office deduction I was eligible for.\n\nAccording to the IRS guidelines, I could deduct a portion of my home expenses as a business expense, based on the ratio of my home office space to the total square footage of our house. This year, those expenses added up to $18000, a significant portion of which could be considered business-related. To determine the exact amount, I broke down the total expenses into categories such as mortgage interest, property taxes, insurance, maintenance, and utilities, and then applied the home office ratio to each category. The calculation was straightforward, but it did require some time and attention to detail.\n\nAfter crunching the numbers, I arrived at a home office deduction of $5400, which represented 30% of our total home expenses for the year. It was a sizable deduction, one that I was grateful for, given the significant amount of time I spent working from home. By claiming this deduction, I was able to reduce my taxable income and lower my tax liability, a welcome relief in an already busy year. As I filed my taxes, I felt confident in the accuracy of my home office deduction, knowing that I had taken the time to understand and apply the relevant tax laws and regulations.",

  "question": "What percentage of home expenses can be deducted?",
  "correct_answer": "30%",
  "reasoning_steps": [
    "To calculate the percentage of home expenses that can be deducted, we need to follow these steps:",
    "The home office space is used for business purposes 9 months out of the year, so the business use percentage is calculated as (9/12) * 100 to find the percentage of the year the space is used for business = 75%.",
    "The business use percentage of the home's total square footage is 300 square feet / 2400 square feet = 0.125 or 12.5%.",
    "The total home expenses for the year are $18000, but only the business use percentage of the home can be deducted, so we multiply the total home expenses by the business use percentage of the square footage to find the deductible amount."
