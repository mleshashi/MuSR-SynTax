  "narrative": "As a freelance writer, I've grown accustomed to the flexibility of working from home, but that doesn't mean it's without its challenges. With a dedicated home office that I've set up in a cozy nook of our 2500-square-foot house, I've managed to carve out a productive workspace that's all my own. At 150 square feet, it's a modest space, but it's perfect for my needs. When I'm not typing away on my laptop or attending to clients on the phone, I love to step back and appreciate how seamlessly it blends into the rest of our home.\n\nThis year has been a particularly productive one, and I've seen my freelance business continue to grow. As a result, I've been able to take on more clients and projects, which has meant an increase in my annual income. With that comes the added expense of maintaining our home, and this year was no exception. Our annual expenses added up to $18,000, covering everything from property taxes and utilities to maintenance and repairs. As I sit here in my home office, surrounded by the familiar sights and sounds of our home, I'm reminded of how fortunate I am to be able to work from the comfort of my own home.\n\nCome tax time, I'll be eligible to claim a home office deduction for the space I use exclusively for work. To calculate this deduction, I'll need to determine the percentage of our total home's square footage that my home office occupies. Since my office is 150 sq ft and our total home is 2500 sq ft, that puts the percentage at 6%. I can then apply this percentage to our total home expenses for the year to determine the amount of the deduction I'm eligible for. It's a straightforward process, but it's one that I'm grateful to be able to take advantage of, as it will help reduce my taxable income and put more money back in my pocket.",

  "question": "What percentage of home expenses can be deducted?",
  "correct_answer": "6% \n\n(150 sq ft / 2500 sq ft) * 100 = 6%",
  "reasoning_steps": [
    "To calculate the percentage of home expenses that can be deducted, consider the following steps:",
    "The home office is exclusively used for business, so its expenses are directly related to the business.",
    "The total square footage of the home is 2500 sq ft, and the home office is 150 sq ft in size, so the ratio of home office space to total home space can be calculated.",
    "The ratio of home office space to total home space can be applied to the total annual home expenses for the year, even though the home office was only used for 8 months."
