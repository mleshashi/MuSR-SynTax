  "narrative": "As the founder of her own marketing consulting firm, Emily had grown accustomed to the flexibility of working from home. In a converted guest room, she had created a dedicated home office space that was tailored to her needs as a business owner. The room was equipped with a spacious desk, a comfortable office chair, and high-speed internet connectivity. Emily spent most of her workday in this room, meeting with clients, brainstorming marketing campaigns, and managing her business's social media presence.\n\nGiven the Simplified Option for calculating her home office deduction, Emily decided to use a specific measurement to simplify the process. She took note of the square footage of her home office space and divided it by the total square footage of her home. This calculation gave her a ratio, which she would use to determine the percentage of her home that was dedicated to business use. According to the Simplified Option, Emily could then multiply the business use percentage by her total mortgage interest and property taxes for the year to arrive at her home office deduction.\n\nTo qualify for the home office deduction, Emily ensured that her home office space was used exclusively for business purposes. She had designated the room as her workspace and avoided using it for personal activities, such as watching TV or storing personal belongings. By maintaining a clear separation between her business and personal life, Emily was able to take advantage of the home office deduction, which helped to offset her business expenses and reduce her taxable income.",

  "question": "What percentage of home expenses can be deducted?",
  "correct_answer": "Business use percentage of total home area",
  "reasoning_steps": [
    "Home office space is a dedicated area used regularly for business, which implies it is a distinct part of the overall home.",
    "Home office deduction is subject to the Simplified Option, which deducts a fixed amount per square foot, but the problem asks for the percentage of home expenses that can be deducted, not the fixed amount.",
    "The percentage of home expenses that can be deducted depends on the business use of the home, not the overall size of the home.",
    "Business use percentage of total home area is the standard method for determining the business use percentage in the Simplified Option."
