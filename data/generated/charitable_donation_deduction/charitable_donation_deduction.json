  "narrative": "As the holiday season approached, Sarah found herself reflecting on her blessings. She had always been grateful for her family's stability and her own good health, and she felt compelled to give back to those in need. After researching various charities, Sarah decided to donate $800 in cash to St Jude Children's Research Hospital, a renowned institution dedicated to finding cures for childhood cancer and other life-threatening diseases. The organization's commitment to providing free medical care to children from low-income families resonated deeply with Sarah.\n\nIn preparation for tax season, Sarah gathered her documents to ensure she was eligible for a charitable deduction on her donation. She remembered learning that she could deduct her charitable contributions up to a certain percentage of her Adjusted Gross Income (AGI). After calculating her AGI, which came out to $90,000, Sarah confirmed that she was subject to the 50% AGI limitation on her cash donation. According to her tax professional, this meant she could deduct 50% of her AGI, or $45,000, from her total taxable income. Given the $800 donation to St Jude, Sarah was pleased to learn that she could claim a charitable deduction of $400, which she would be able to subtract from her taxable income.\n\nWith her charitable deduction in mind, Sarah felt even more satisfied with her decision to support St Jude. She was proud to contribute to an organization that was making a tangible difference in the lives of young patients and their families. As she prepared to file her taxes, Sarah felt confident that her donation would not only benefit the worthy cause but also bring her a measure of tax relief. By taking advantage of the charitable deduction, Sarah could reduce her tax liability and use the savings to support her own family's well-being.",

  "question": "How much charitable deduction is allowed?",
  "correct_answer": "$400",
  "reasoning_steps": [
    "The 50% AGI limitation applies to Sarah's cash donation of $800.",
    "Sarah's Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) is $90,000, which is higher than the cash donation of $800, so the limitation applies.",
    "The cash donation of $800 is greater than 50% of Sarah's AGI (0.5 * $90,000 = $45,000), so the limitation is not met with the $800 in full.",
    "Since the limitation is 50% of AGI and $800 is below this at $45,000, the full $800 is deductible."
