  "narrative": "As Emily sat down at her desk to tackle the paperwork for her taxes, she thought about the various contributions she had made throughout the year. One thing that stood out was a $500 cash donation she had made to the local children's hospital. Emily had always been moved by the hospital's mission to provide high-quality care to families in need, and this donation was her way of giving back. She had written a check directly from her account, so she knew she would need to itemize her deductions to claim the charitable contribution.\n\nAs she began to fill out the necessary forms, Emily remembered that she would need to adhere to the 50% adjusted gross income (AGI) limitation for charitable donations. Her AGI for the year was $90,000, which meant that she could only deduct up to $45,000 in itemized deductions, including her cash donation to the children's hospital. This limitation was in place to prevent high-income individuals from deducting excessive charitable contributions. Emily's donation of $500 was well within the limit, so she was pleased to be able to claim it as a deduction.\n\nEmily carefully entered the donation on Form 8283, Statement of Noncash Contributions, and noted the $500 amount on her Schedule A, Itemized Deductions. She also made sure to keep a record of her donation, including the receipt from the charity, in case of an audit. As she finished up her taxes, Emily felt a sense of satisfaction knowing that her contribution was making a difference in the lives of those in need. She was grateful for the opportunity to give back, and she looked forward to continuing her charitable efforts in the years to come.",

  "question": "How much charitable deduction is allowed?",
  "correct_answer": "$300",
  "reasoning_steps": [
    "The 50% AGI limitation applies to Emily's cash donation, which means she can only deduct up to 50% of her AGI.",
    "% of Emily's AGI is $90,000 * 0.5 = $45,000, so her charitable donation of $500 can only be deducted up to $45,000.",
    "Since Emily made a $500 cash donation, and the deduction limit is $45,000, she is limited to deducting the full $500 donation amount within the first $45,000 of the 50% AGI limitation.",
    "Therefore, Emily's charitable deduction allowed is the minimum of $500 and the remaining deduction limit after reaching $45,000, which is $300."
