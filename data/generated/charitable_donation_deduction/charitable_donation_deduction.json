  "narrative": "As the end of the year approached, Sarah began to review her charitable contributions to ensure she could take advantage of the tax benefits. She had been a long-time supporter of her local food bank, which provided essential services to families in need. This year, Sarah had made a particularly generous donation of $500 to help the food bank continue its vital work. The food bank was a qualified 501(c)(3) charity, which meant that her contribution would be eligible for a tax deduction.\n\nWith her adjusted gross income (AGI) of $110,000, Sarah knew she was well within the cash donation limitation of 60% of her AGI. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) allowed taxpayers to deduct up to 50% of their AGI for cash donations to qualified charities, but in this case, the 60% limit still applied because it was a cash contribution and the 50% limit only applies to non-cash contributions. Sarah was grateful for the opportunity to give back to her community and was looking forward to claiming the deduction on her tax return.\n\nSarah had kept a record of her donation, including the receipt from the food bank and a cancelled check as proof of payment. She would need to report the $500 contribution on Schedule A of her tax return, which listed her itemized deductions. By itemizing her deductions, Sarah could claim the charitable contribution and potentially reduce her taxable income, resulting in a lower tax liability.",

  "question": "How much charitable deduction is allowed?",
  "correct_answer": "$500",
  "reasoning_steps": [
    "Sarah's $500 cash donation meets the requirements for a charitable deduction because it was made to a qualified 501(c)(3) charity.",
    "Sarah's contribution is not subject to the 50% AGI limitation since her AGI is below the threshold of this limitation.",
    "Since her AGI is above the standard deduction threshold, the 50% AGI limitation for cash donations does not apply to her, and she is not subject to any further limitations that would reduce the deduction.",
    "As a result, Sarah is allowed the full $500 charitable deduction, which is fully deductible under IRC Section 170."
