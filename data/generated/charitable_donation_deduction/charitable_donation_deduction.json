  "narrative": "As the tax filing season approached, Sarah began gathering her receipts and records for the past year's charitable donations. She had always been diligent about giving back to her community, and she knew that her contributions would not only benefit the causes she supported but also provide a valuable tax benefit. Among her donations was a generous gift to the local children's hospital, which she had visited with her family the previous year. The hospital, a qualified 501(c)(3) organization as described in IRC Section 170(c), was dedicated to providing medical care and support to underprivileged children in the area. Sarah's donation of $10,000 in cash was a significant contribution to their efforts, and she was eager to take advantage of the tax deduction.\n\nAs she reviewed her records, Sarah also considered her donation of a limited edition art piece to the city's art museum. The artwork, which she had acquired several years ago, had appreciated significantly in value and was now worth $25,000. She had decided to donate it to the museum, which was also a qualified charitable organization. However, under IRC Section 170(e)(1)(A), contributions of capital gain property, such as this art piece, were subject to a 30% limitation of her adjusted gross income (AGI). This meant that she could only deduct 30% of her AGI, or $7,500, in this case, regardless of the art piece's actual value. Sarah was aware of this limitation but was still pleased to be making a significant contribution to the museum's collection.\n\nSarah's accountant advised her to itemize her deductions on her tax return, which would allow her to take advantage of the charitable donation deductions. In addition to the hospital and museum donations, she also had receipts for several other charitable contributions, including a cash donation to a food bank and a volunteer service at a local animal shelter. With her accountant's guidance, Sarah was confident that she would be able to maximize her charitable donation deductions and minimize her tax liability for the year.",

  "question": "How much charitable deduction is allowed?",
  "correct_answer": "50% of the meal cost (subject to IRC Section 274)",
  "reasoning_steps": [
    "The charitable donation deduction is allowed based on the type of contribution made and the donor's adjusted gross income (AGI).",
    "The contribution is a cash donation, which is subject to a 50% limitation of adjusted gross income (AGI) for federal income tax purposes.",
    "As the deduction is for the meal cost, it is subject to IRC Section 274, which governs deductions for meals and entertainment.",
    "The deduction for the meal cost is therefore allowed at 50% of its cost, as per the 50% limitation in IRC Section 170 for cash charitable donations."
