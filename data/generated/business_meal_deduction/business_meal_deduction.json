  "narrative": "As the marketing team's lead, I was tasked with planning a company retreat to discuss our quarterly goals and objectives. The event was a crucial part of our ordinary business practice, providing an opportunity for team members to collaborate, build relationships, and align with company vision. We decided to hold the retreat at a local hotel, which offered a convenient and comfortable setting for our discussions. On the final evening, we hosted a dinner for the entire team, which included a mix of company employees and key clients who had joined us for presentations and meetings.\n\nThe dinner, which cost approximately $300, was a necessary expense as it allowed us to foster relationships with our clients in a relaxed setting. These client meetings were a vital part of our marketing strategy, providing us with opportunities to showcase our products and services, gather feedback, and develop new business leads. The casual atmosphere of the dinner helped to break the ice and facilitated open discussions, making it easier for us to build trust and establish strong working relationships with our clients. By investing in our clients and team members, we were able to drive business growth and achieve our company's goals.\n\nIn terms of tax implications, the $300 dinner expense would be considered a legitimate business deduction. As the event was an ordinary business practice and the dinner was directly related to client meetings and team building, we could claim the full amount as a business expense on our tax return. This would help to reduce our taxable income and minimize our tax liability, allowing us to reinvest the savings in other areas of the business.",

  "question": "How much of the meal expense is deductible?",
  "correct_answer": "$225",
  "reasoning_steps": [
    "The total cost of the meal is only deductible for the portion related to the business purpose, which is the client meetings, since the employee portion is considered personal entertainment.",
    "The client-to-employee ratio is 1:3, meaning that for each client, there are three employees, indicating that the client meetings are the primary purpose of the event.",
    "Since there are two clients and six employees, the client portion of the event is 2/8 (clients:total attendees) or 1/4 of the total meal expense.",
    "Therefore, 1/4 of the total meal expense of $300 is deductible."
