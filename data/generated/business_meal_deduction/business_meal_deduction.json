  "narrative": "It was a busy week at Smith & Co., and our team was eager to dive into the latest project strategies. Our marketing team had suggested a working dinner to discuss the details, and our CEO agreed it was a great idea. We chose a restaurant with a private room that could accommodate our team of eight, and the bill came out to be $250. As a company, we're used to deducting business meals, but we always make sure to follow the IRS guidelines carefully.\n\nOur accountant, Sarah, reviewed the receipt and calculated the deduction. According to the IRS, business meals at a client's hotel suite qualify for the 50% deduction if they're ordinary and necessary for a sales meeting. However, since our working dinner was not at a client's hotel suite, we couldn't take the full deduction. But we could still claim a portion of the expense. Sarah explained to our team that under IRC Section 274, we could deduct 50% of the $250 expense, which came out to be $125. This way, we could write off half of the cost, allowing us to focus on the project at hand.\n\nThe working dinner was a huge success, and our team came up with some innovative ideas to move the project forward. We were able to take a break from the office and bond over some great food and conversation. It was a well-spent $125, and we're looking forward to seeing the project's progress in the coming weeks. As we move forward, we'll continue to keep track of our business meals and expenses, making sure to follow the IRS guidelines to ensure we're taking advantage of the deductions we're eligible for.",

  "correct_answer": "$125",
  "reasoning_steps": [
    "The company spent $250 on a working dinner for 8 employees at a restaurant to discuss new project strategies, which is an ordinary and necessary business expense for corporate tax purposes.",
    "The company can deduct 50% of the meal expense under IRC Section 274, as business meals for employees are considered ordinary and necessary for business purposes.",
    "The amount deductible for the working dinner is calculated as 50% of $250, which is $125.",
    "This $125 deduction does not change due to the fact that the working dinner was for employees rather than clients, as both cases qualify for meal deductions under IRC Section 274."
